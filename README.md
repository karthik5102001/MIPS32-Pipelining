# Verilog Implementation of MIPS32 Pipeline

Exploring more on magic of MIPS

## Abstract
MIPS stands for Microprocessor without Interlocked Pipe Stages.
In an interlocked pipeline, hardware is used to check for hazards between stages ( eg: does the next instruction need to read a register or not).
This microprocessor architecture that uses a reduced instruction set computing (RISC) approach.
